# environment-enforcer
Experimental project in enforcing argument availability

# Goals
1. Create library that can validate and obtain if a necessary arguments from (in order):
   1. A command line variable
   2. An argparse compatible file
   3. A system environment variable
   5. Console Interaction with the user to obtain what is required (if allowed)
2. Extend knowledge of Python and Python Module development

It is acknowledged that an available library may already exist to do this that the author has not yet discovered. No claim is made that this solution is superior to others only that the author chose this use case to develop his skills.
